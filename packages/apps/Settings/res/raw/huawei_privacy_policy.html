<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This
Policy describes how Huawei handles personal and private data and how Huawei is
committed to protecting your privacy. However, one policy may not be expansive
enough to address all concerns of data processing. Therefore, Huawei may
provide additional information that is specific to a product or service as a supplement
to this Policy in order to keep you informed about other data collection
purposes.<br>
<br>
<b>1 How Huawei uses your personal data</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.1 How, when, and for what purposes does Huawei collect and make use of
your personal data?</b><br>
<br>
<b>Creating accounts, and purchasing or registering products or services</b><br>
If you submit requests online to create an account or to purchase or register
our products or services, we may ask you to provide information, such as your
email address, delivery address, phone number, product information, time of
purchase, and method of payment to implement your purchase orders, deliver your
products or services, activate or verify your products, make changes upon your
request, provide technical support or authorized updates, and more.<br>
<br>
<b>Participating in promotions or market surveys</b><br>
After receiving your approval, we may ask you to provide relevant information,
such as your phone number and email address, to contact you, send you
information about products and services that you may be interested in or invite
you to Huawei's promotions and market surveys upon your agreement. You can ask
Huawei not to use your personal data for promotions or market surveys. To do
so, opt out or turn off such options on Huawei websites or from individual product
settings, or contact us by sending an email to </span><span lang=EN-US><a
href="mailto:mobile@huawei.com"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>mobile@huawei.com</span></a></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing content with your friends</b><br>
If you use Huawei services to share content with your friends, we may need you
to provide your friends' contact information, including but not limited to any
SNS accounts and email addresses. Huawei may use such information to send
invitations to your friends by email, instant messages, SNS, or SMS/MMS. The
information will only be used for the purpose of sending invitations. Huawei
will not save this information or use such information for other purposes.<br>
<br>
<b>Update</b><br>
Huawei may collect system and application data from your devices in order to
inform you about available system or application updates. Such information may
include your device name, system and application versions, region and language
settings, device identification numbers (IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN), and your
service provider's network ID. Huawei processes such information for the sole
purpose of informing you about system or application updates.<br>
<br>
<b>Statistics</b><br>
Huawei may collect certain information for analysis, including your device
name, device version, device identification numbers (IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN),
the fuzzy geographic location information of your device (such as the ID of the
area where your device is located), your service provider's network ID (PLMN),
how you use your applications, and the IP address you use to access the
Internet. Huawei collects and processes such information to provide you with
the best personalized user experience and to customize content, improve our
products, analyze the efficiency of our business operations, analyze our market
share, improve the security of Huawei's networks and services, and activate
your after-sale services.<br>
<br>
<b>Troubleshooting</b><br>
If your device or application experiences any errors, you can choose to send
the error information to Huawei so that Huawei and Huawei's partners can
provide you with troubleshooting services. Huawei may collect relevant
information about the issue, such as your device model, application name and
version, device identification number, and error logs.<br>
<br>
<b>Synchronizing, sharing, and storing data</b><br>
Some of the services that Huawei provides allow you to synchronize, share, and
store data. Huawei may collect and store data that you upload or download and
data required to implement the uploads and downloads. <br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Location-based services</b><br>
When you access certain location-based services, for example, when you search
for information, navigate, or check the weather based on specific locations,
Huawei may collect, use, and process the precise or fuzzy location information
of your device. This is to allow Huawei to provide the preceding services for
you. Information collected may include your device identification numbers
(IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN), type, model, and real-time location information
(including that obtained through GPS, Wi-Fi, and your service provider's
network ID). Huawei collects location information anonymously to provide and
improve location-based products and services.<br>
<br>
<b>1.3 Collection and use of non-personal information</b><br>
&quot;Non-personal information&quot; refers to information that cannot be used
to identify a specific person. Huawei may collect aggregate statistical
information, such as the number of visitors to our website. Huawei collects
such information to understand how people use our website, products, or
services. In this way, Huawei can improve and streamline our services to better
meet customer needs. Huawei may, at its own discretion, collect, use, transfer,
or disclose non-personal information for other purposes.<br>
<br>
<b>2 How Huawei uses cookies</b><br>
To make sure our websites function properly, we sometimes place small data
files on your computer or mobile devices, known as cookies. A cookie is a
simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website's
server, and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the content of
that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It contains anonymous
information, such as a unique identifier, the site name, digits, and
characters. Cookies allow websites to remember information, such as your
preferences or what's in your shopping basket.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Most
large websites or Internet service providers do this in order to improve user
experience by enabling websites to &quot;remember&quot; you, either during your
single visit (using a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or for repeated visits (using
a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;). Cookies help websites remember your settings
– language, font size, and other preferences for how you want to view the
website on your computer or mobile device. This way, you don't have to keep
re-entering them whenever you come back to us. If a website doesn't use
cookies, it will deem you as a new visitor every time you open a new page on
the website. For example, when you enter your login details and move to another
page, the website won't recognize you, and it won't be able to keep you logged
in. Our cookies are not used to identify you personally. They're just there to
make the website work better for you.<br>

<b>3 How Huawei discloses your personal data</b><br>
Huawei will never sell your personal data to third parties without your
knowledge. However, Huawei may disclose your personal data in the following
situations:<br>
(i) You have explicitly agreed to the disclosure:<br>
After obtaining your approval, Huawei may share your personal information with
other companies;<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>(ii) Disclose your
personal information to other Huawei subsidiaries or authorized cooperating
third parties.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Huawei
may need to provide you with certain services through some cooperating parties.
Therefore, Huawei may share some of your personal information with cooperating
parties to enrich our services and improve your overall experience. For
example, when you decide to purchase Huawei products online, Huawei will need
to submit your personal information to relevant logistic service providers to
allow them to deliver the products to you, or allow our cooperating parties to
provide you with other services. Huawei forbids all Huawei subsidiaries or authorized
third parties to use shared personal information for any other purposes.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>(iii)
Disclose your personal information under legal requirements:<br>
Huawei may disclose your personal information when required by the law, legal
proceedings, litigation, or public, governmental authorities. Your personal
information may also be disclosed to transaction parties under circumstances
that Huawei is involved in such as reorganization, merger, or insolvency
liquidation.<br>
<br>
<b>4 How to modify, change, or check your personal data</b><br>
You will be responsible for the accuracy of the personal information you
submit. Huawei makes the best commercial endeavor to keep the accuracy of your
personal information, and Huawei will delete or amend the information upon your
request. You can contact us by emailing </span><span lang=EN-US><a
href="mailto:mobile@huawei.com"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>mobile@huawei.com</span></a></span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>. Under
the terms and conditions of Huawei, you can manage your personal information at
any time, such as your personal account registration information.<br>
<br>
<b>5 How Huawei protects your personal data</b><br>
Huawei takes reasonable preventive measures, including but not limited to,
technical, physical, and regulatory actions to protect your personal
information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, change, damage, or loss.
For example, from a technical perspective, Huawei uses anti-virus software to
encrypt and monitor our systems and protect data centers from malicious
attacks. From a physical perspective, Huawei has set in place visit control
mechanisms, allowing only authorized personnel to access some personal data. From
a regulatory perspective, Huawei makes sure employees understand the importance
of protecting personal data through training sessions on security and privacy
protection awareness. Although we take the utmost care to protect your personal
data, please note that no security measures are 100% perfect or unbreakable.<br>
<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>6 How Huawei handles the personal data of minors</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
Unless required by law, Huawei will not collect personal data from minors
without seeking prior parental consent. We will only use or disclose personal
data about a minor to the extent permitted by law, with parental consent
according to local laws and regulations, or to protect the minor. The
definition of a minor may vary depending on applicable laws and local cultural
customs.<br>
<br>
<b>7 Who the third party service providers are</b><br>
To ensure an efficient visit and improve user experience, you may be provided
with content or Internet hyperlinks from third parties. You can choose whether
to access such hyperlinks or content or use services and products of these
third parties, over which Huawei does not have control. Huawei cannot control
any privacy and data protection measures of third parties, and such measures
will not be governed by this Policy either. This Policy does not apply to any
information that you voluntarily provide to third parties. Please refer to the
privacy protection policies of the third parties instead.<br>
<br>
<b>8 How data is transferred</b><br>
Huawei products and services may be provided using resources and servers
located in various countries and regions around the world. Therefore, your
personal information may be transferred across international borders outside
the country where you use our services. Those countries may not have laws
providing specific protection for personal data, or they may have different
legal regulations on data protection. In such cases, Huawei will ensure that
there is a legal basis for such transfers and that adequate protection for your
personal data is provided as required by applicable laws. For example, Huawei
may use standard agreements approved by corresponding authorities (where
necessary) or take other appropriate technical and organizational information
protection measures.<br>
<br>
<b>9 How this Policy is updated</b><br>
Huawei may update or amend this Policy from time to time. Huawei will generally
try to notify you of the changes through different channels. Please check for
the latest version of this Policy on our official website.<br>
